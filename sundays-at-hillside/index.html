<h1>Sundays at Hillside</h1><p> Our Sunday morning services are at 9:00am and 10:30am. We would love for you to join us. At Hillside you can expect good upbeat music, thought provoking teaching that will challenge and inspire you, and a community of people that will welcome you with a smile. We know that visiting a church for the first time can be intimidating. This page should answer most of your questions and let you know what to expect. </p><p><b>How do I get there and what about parking? </b>You can get a map and directions on our directions page. We have two parking lots; if the upper lot is full there is additional parking across the street. Most sundays a shuttle will be available to take you up the hill. </p><p><b>Who will be there?</b> Hillside is a diverse group of people from all across Marin County. Some have been Christians for years; others are trying to decide if they even believe in a God. You will see a lot of families and lots of kids. But what most people notice is that everyone is smiling! What you won’t find is a bunch of people pretending to be perfect with a holier-than-thou attitude. This is a group of people becoming, a group of people with hope and joy. </p><p><b>What should I wear?</b> We are a community of friends, so dress like you would if you were stopping by a friend’s house. Dress casually and you’ll fit right in. </p><p><b>Is there something for my kids?</b> Yes! Our main environments for children from infants to 5th graders are offered during both morning services. Your children will laugh, learn and grow through age appropriate activities that are fun and safe. There is a special gathering for middle and high school students during the 10:30am service. The Preschool, Elementary, and Middle/High School sections of this site contain detailed information on what we offer for your kids. </p><p><b>What happens during the gathering? </b>Most weeks follow a similar pattern: music, an offering, a talk, communion and coffee. </p><ul><li>Music: Music speaks to our hearts and in turn helps us express our hearts to God. We sing as a response to God. Sing along if you like or just listen and enjoy. We usually start with two or three upbeat songs. </li></ul><ul><li> Offering: Hillside is fully supported by the gifts of its members and regular attendees. If you are visiting we want you to be our guest; you don’t need to put anything in the basket. </li></ul><ul><li> Talk: Each week we listen to a talk given by one of our pastors. The talks are interesting, relevant, challenging, inspiring, and always seek to relate our 21st century lives to the timeless truths of God and His love. To get an idea of what the talks are like you can listen to past ones online. </li></ul><ul><li> Communion: Jesus is the center of who we are as a church and communion is a reminder of what He did for us. On the first Sunday of every month, we offer communion as an opportunity to reflect and remember. </li></ul><ul><li> Coffee: Before and after each service there is coffee and tea in the foyer. Grab a cup and get to know some of the people that make up Hillside.</li></ul></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Sundays at Hillside</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
