            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sundays at Hillside</h1><p> Our Sunday morning services are at 9:00am and 10:30am. We would love for you to join us. At Hillside you can expect good upbeat music, thought provoking teaching that will challenge and inspire you, and a community of people that will welcome you with a smile. We know that visiting a church for the first time can be intimidating. This page should answer most of your questions and let you know what to expect. </p></article>]]></description>
